# Improving-Preparedness-in-Epidemic-Healthcare-

In analytics, the important part is to make a story of the data that you have in a raw form. You clean the data, manipulate it, and analyze it to represent a trend. My favorite application of analytics is “Forecasting” using the STAR method. Recently for my last semester minor project, I worked on Improving Preparedness in Epidemic Healthcare using Data Science where I have to build a system to help healthcare organizations to get prepared in advance by analyzing the trends in the number of cases per year/per week in a particular region of epidemic disease(Dengue)to forecast the future number of cases. I took a dataset containing dengue data for 3 regions Puerto Rico, San Juan, and Peru and cleaned the data using R programming with R studio where I removed the null values, have performed other functions, after cleaning I worked on finding data trends to predict the future cases. After this, I represented the trend, forecast using Tableau and sent the data to the organizations with effective measures to take to get prepared in advance for the increase or decrease in the number of cases for upcoming weeks and years. I successfully build a system and shared the outcome.
